# Brainwave Matrix Intern

A concise README to introduce the Brainwave_Matrix_Intern repository, explain its purpose, how to set up and run it, and how to contribute. Replace any placeholder sections with project-specific details as needed.

## Description

Brainwave Matrix Intern is a project created for internship tasks and exercises. This repository contains code, notebooks, documentation, and resources used during the internship period. The repository aims to demonstrate learning progress, experiments, and sample applications built while working with data, machine learning, and web technologies.

## Features

- Well-structured examples and exercises
- Notebooks showcasing experiments and visualizations
- Sample applications and scripts for quick demonstrations

## Tech stack

- Languages: Python, JavaScript (update if different)
- Frameworks/Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (update accordingly)
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Git

## Repository structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with experiments and analyses
- `src/` - Source code for applications and utilities
- `data/` - Datasets or scripts to fetch data (do not store large datasets in repo)
- `docs/` - Documentation and design notes
- `examples/` - Small example projects or demos

Update these paths to match the repository actual layout.
